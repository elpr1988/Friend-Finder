# Friend-Finder
A full-stack site which takes in results from users' surveys, then compares their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

## Survey
Survey asks 10 questions. Each answer will be on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

Once the survey is submitted, the app will determine the user's most compatible friend.
    * A modal will display both the name and picture of the closest match.
